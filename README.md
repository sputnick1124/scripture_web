# Scripture Web
Web map of standard works and all links between verses.
To be driven by Python using BeautifulSoup and Bokeh.
Maybe Pandas will be helpful as well.

TODO items:
 - Figure out how to organize the data on the backend (standard_works class structure, book/chapter/verse methods? pd.Dataframe?). 
   Should be as modular as possible so a user can add links/chains/materials as needed
 - Read in scripture (meta)data using bs4
 - Learn Bokeh
